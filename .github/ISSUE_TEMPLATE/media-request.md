1. Only helpers who have built and hosted their first mission may request uploads to this mod.
2. Do not request every music track you might use. Ensure what is being uploaded will be used to avoid increasing the mod size for no good reason.
3. Do not make your missions dependent on this mod updating in time. If you do so then it is your own fault.
4. Video files will require approval of the Event Team Lead(s) and will not be done often due to OGV file sizes.
5. No one in the team is required to keep updating this mod. If you are so invested in it updating then please learn how to use Github and how to follow the naming and file structure convention so you can also do updates to the mod.

All good? Then proceed and fill out the items below.
